                    The Online store was officially launched in June 2011, following
                    the successful acquisition of an existing ecommerce business
                    called Take2 by the US-based investment firm, Tiger Global
                    Management and Kim Reid in October 2010. Today, The Online Store
                    is the leading ecommerce retailer in South Africa and one of the
                    largest, most innovative ecommerce retailers on the African
                    continent.

            <div class="box paragraphs" style="background-color: #00bfff">
                <p>
                    The business was initiated with a simple vision in mind: To be the
                    largest, simplest, most customer-centric online shopping
                    destination in Africa. It has rapidly evolved since inception,
                    opening and expanding warehouses in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape
                    Town, while expanding department selection to over 21 departments
                    across Electronics, Lifestyle, Media & Gaming and Fashion.

                    For The Online Store, 2014 was a truly pivotal year with the
                    announcement of a $100m investment from Tiger Global. This was
                    quickly followed by the purchase of Mr Delivery – which gave the
                    business ownership over its own logistics network through the The
                    Online Store Delivery Team division (formerly Mr D Courier) and
                    its own app-based on-demand food delivery service through the MR D
                    Online store division.

                    The same year saw the successful acquisition of Superbalist.com, a
                    curated design and fashion website, and culminated in the
                    announcement that Naspers-owned Kalahari.com would be merging
                    businesses with The Online Store – building the premier online
                    shopping destination in Africa. The merge was successfully
                    completed on 1 May 2015 when all Kalahari customer accounts were
                    successfully transferred to The Online Store.

                    in early 2018, Naspers increased its investment in The Online
                    Store to 96%. In October 2018, Superbalist.com and Spree (also
                    part of the Naspers family) merged to provide customers with the
                    latest on-trend local and international fashion.

                    Now, The Online Store is South Africa’s largest, most innovative
                    ecommerce retailer, with over 2000 employees. At the core of
