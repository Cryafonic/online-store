    <!-- here is a few paragraphs dicribing how the shipping works and the tearm for using it. -->
    <p>
        Irrespective of the delivery method you choose, we always take
        responsibility up to the point of delivery, i.e. if your parcel goes
        missing or the contents are damaged, we will replace the affected items
        at no cost to you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please note that the time taken to ship an item is listed on each
        product's detail page. For example, "Usually shipped within 2-5 working
        days" means that it will take us 2-5 working days to get the product
        from our supplier. The delivery times listed below apply once we ship
        the item to you.<br/>

        We currently offer four methods of delivery.
    </p>
    <h3>Detail</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Courier.</strong> These are door-to-door services. The delivery
        address must be a physical address, and cannot be a post office box.
        Someone will need to be available at the address to receive the
        delivery. Deliveries are made during business hours from Monday to
        Friday. We currently offer three courier options.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>Priority courier.</em> In main centres, this will reach you the
            next business day after we ship your order.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Standard courier.</em> In main centres, this will reach you within
            1- 2 business days after we ship your order.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Economy courier.</em> In main centres, this will reach you within
            1 - 3 business days after we ship your order.
        </li>

        Main centres include properties within a 50km radius of the major cities
        in South Africa. If you are not in a main centre, it may take a few days
        longer. We do not deliver by courier to plots, farms, mines, military
        bases, major chain stores, power stations, game reserves and lodges,
        airports or harbours, and should your delivery address fall into one of
        these categories you will be liable for the extra costs incurred in
        delivering or returning the parcel.
